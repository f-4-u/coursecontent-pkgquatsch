This little bash script was an exercise during a Linux course with the following conditions:

- it should be robust and nicely programmed
- if there is no switch, a confirmation (y/n) should be requested
- it should output how many packages are installed
- should generate a package list of all installed packages on the system
- should have the possibility to install them on a new system
